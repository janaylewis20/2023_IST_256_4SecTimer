# 2023_IST_256_4SecTimer
Welcome to my 4 second timer game!
The objective is to click as close to 4 seconds as possible. 

This code features:

A Large button saying Start
User clicks button and the button text says Stop
The user is provided the elapsed time in seconds. The button text returns to Start. If the elapsed time is 4 seconds then display green indications, if the time is within +/- .2 seconds display blue indication, if the elapsed time is within +/- .5 seconds display yellow indication and anything greater is red.
Thank you!
